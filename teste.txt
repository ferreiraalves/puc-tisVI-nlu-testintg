Restless tonight 'cos I wasted the light between both these times I drew a really thin line  It's nothing I planned and not that I can But you should be mine across that line  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing... If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn't that be something?  I promise I might not walk on by Maybe next time but not this time  Even though I know I don't want to know Yeah, I guess I know I just hate how it sounds  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing... If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn't that be something?
P2 was absolutely horrible. The trig question took me more than 10 minutes to do, and I still couldn't do it. (But then again, I'm stupid.) Actually most people found it quite difficult, but I'm sure I'm the only Further Maths person who lost more than 15 marks already. AHHH well... That's life.   Still got M2 on Friday... AHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhh~~~
